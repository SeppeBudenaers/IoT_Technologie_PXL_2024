## Introduction
With this project we have automated the process to remotely control an LED strip that is connected to a Pi. 

- In this Github you can find the following information:
  * How to setup a Raspberry Pi to utilize SSH.
  * How to connect to that Raspberry Pi remotely and safely by setting up Tailscale.
  * How to connect a led strip to the Pi and write code for it in Python.
  * How to setup a simple CRUD inside of Azure (partially).
  * How to automate all of this using Github actions.
  * How to combine and run all of this.
