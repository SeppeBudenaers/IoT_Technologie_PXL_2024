# IoT_Technologie_PXL_2023_2024

## Introduction
we developed an IoT device that is capable of over-the-air updates. The IoT device retrieves color values from an API server to control a WS2812 LED strip. This functionality is achieved using a (CRUD)API server writen in golang and a docker container that runs the python program for the IoT device.

- In this Github you can find the following information:
  * How to setup a Raspberry Pi to utilize SSH **(Securely)**. 
  * How to control a ws2812 led strip with a Pi running a Python dockercontainer.
  * How to setup a simple CRUD inside of Azure (partially).
  * How to automate all of this using Github actions.
